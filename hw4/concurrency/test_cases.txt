Explanation:


Part1: 

We run 3 processes concurrently. Each is responsible for lighting up one row of the LED matrix. P1 lights up 1 second then delays 1 second,
P2 lights up 2 second then delays 2 seconds, and P3 lights up 4 second then delays 4 seconds. You can watch the video to see that the rows are controlled synchronously.



Part2:

This is similar to part 1, except with locks at each iteration of the while loops. Only one row of the LED lights up at once.
