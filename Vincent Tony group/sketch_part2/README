The main program uses caller-saved registers to preserve their values.

Initally a and b are stored in r24 and r22.

sumval: 1. Arguments are stored in r24 and r22
	2. Return value is stored in r24 and r25
	3. Registers modified: r24 and r25
	4. No stack manipulation within function
Everytime before calling sumval, push r24 and r25.

diffval: 1. Arguments are stored in r24 and r22
	 2. Return value is stored in r24, because the result can fit into a 8-bit register
	 3. Registers modified: r24 and r22
	 4. No stack manipulation within function

Everytime before calling sumval, push r24 and r22.

The main program stores output value in r21 and r20.
